There are three separate tests:

1. Site registration
2. Login with invalid credentials 
3. Login with valid credentials -> search books -> mark them as want to read (3 first books) -> mark them as read -> fill up rate and feedback with different rates -> logout

The recorded video is located in the folder videos

Note: sleep for 1 sec is put in the code to improve video by slowing it down
